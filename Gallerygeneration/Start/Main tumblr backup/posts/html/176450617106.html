They are known for their sexual depravity, total disregard of personal space, and liking towards body modding. It’s rare to find a ‘clean’ one as the ones depicted here, as most will have piercings , tattoos, skin pockets, you mention it.<br/>
Sirens regard them as their bastard cousins, and most other people doesn’t like them much either, but they are valued guards due to their durability -they are to squishy to harm by blunt force- and adherence to oaths.</p> </div>
