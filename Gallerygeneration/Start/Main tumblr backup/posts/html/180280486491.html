                    Hi, I just found your doodle blog on tumblr, sorry for asking here but I didn&amp;#039;t see a place to ask on your other blog.  I was wondering if you&amp;#039;d consider drawing doodle requests?  If so, I&amp;#039;d love it if you could draw Princess Luna? She&amp;#039;s my favorite horse and it would be great if you could draw her with my OC, maybe even holding hooves, or even crazier, touching snoots.  My OC is a nuling, typical green one, nothing special other than a broken fin.  Thanks, yes!                    </div>

  <p><em>“I… I would. Just a little.”</em></p>
  
  <p><em>Luna seemed vaguely disappointing for the shortest moment, but smiled, “I don’t think I am a figment of your imagination, no.”</em></p>

<p>The mess express <a href="https://66.media.tumblr.com/5776e54df1df4ea599f3776d0dbedbf0/tumblr_inline_piga6gnRnO1ux6b56_540.png">has asks enabled</a> but they may not be visible on mobile, I dunno. Either way you can simply append /ask to the url of any tumblr to go to that page.</p>
