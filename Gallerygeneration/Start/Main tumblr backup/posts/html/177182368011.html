                    <p>Since I&rsquo;ve never done this even thought I should&hellip;</p>

<p>Other pages I am active on (Both listed in the page I linked on my sidebar to make this easier) are <a href="https://www.deviantart.com/cammiliscious">deviantart</a>, which I entered very recently so I&rsquo;ve not uploaded my whole backlog (There&rsquo;s a banana-headed Rainbow Dash far behind in my past, after all. Who wants banana heads to loom ever closer?) and, older, <a href="http://pixeljoint.com/p/135941.htm">pixeljoint</a>. Pixeljoint has certain standards though, so I don&rsquo;t put all my pixel art there and by personal choice, I don&rsquo;t upload explicitly pony art there. You can also find my discord contact in the sidebar link if you have any need of it.</p>

<p>Aditionally, in the -reasonable- case someone just doesn&rsquo;t want to deal with crappy javascript (That is, everything widely used that&rsquo;s not pixeljoint) and because of the death of _raw, I made a simple <a href="https://duendeinexistente.github.io/">gallery</a> at github pages. These files aren&rsquo;t processed at all here, which is particularly important with pixel art.</p>

<p>I might start a secondary tumblr to upload art unfiltered sometime in the future, though I don&rsquo;t know if there&rsquo;s any interest in that at all, just to upload all my silly doodles somewhere while keeping a bar of quality in my main blog. Or I may just drop those into the gallery, who knows.</p>
