                    Where and how did you learn how to make digital art?                    </div>
                    <p>I learned from a multitude of places, but mainly from several friends over at a chatroom.</p><p>Things I can advise for you to learn is to check /mlp/’s <a href="http://boards.4chan.org/mlp/catalog#s=improvement">drawfag improvement thread</a> , (the imgur albums will be particularly useful) and to seek feedback from them in a regular basis- they are good folk and more than willing to throw you a hand. <a href="https://discord.gg/XxqyXbK">This chatroom at Discord</a> might also be useful, but I don’t know how active it is. Running a quest in /mlp/ might also be a good way to learn, since it’ll provide regular practice.</p><p>And remember: The core of learning anything is practice, so if you want to learn how to draw, draw.<br/></p>
