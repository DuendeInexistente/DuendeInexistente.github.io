<p>So over the past 10-15 years, as I‚Äôve been trying to branch out, grow a following and sell commissions, there‚Äôs one phrase I‚Äôve heard more than any other.</p>
<p>‚ÄúI‚Äôd love to support you, but I have no money.‚Äù</p>
<p>And you know, I get that. I understand. I don‚Äôt have any either. But here‚Äôs the secret. The most powerful and useful thing you can do to support an artist? It doesn‚Äôt cost a penny. Reblog their posts, signal boost their commissions, advertise their patreon./<br/>If you have commissioned them, or do support their patreon? Write a review, tell your friends, share their links. Keep circulating the tapes.</p>
<p>Every post is an artist laying themselves bare before you. You have the power to make them into somebody. You can make them into a big name, you can help bring them an income. All you have to do is share.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a handy infographic.</p>
<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="421" data-orig-width="494" data-orig-src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/f39dba51aae8e38921ce5ef08313f8c1/tumblr_inline_p4bqb5vST81r66idw_540.png"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/f39dba51aae8e38921ce5ef08313f8c1/tumblr_inline_p4bqbx8o5n1r66idw_540.png" data-orig-height="421" data-orig-width="494" data-orig-src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/f39dba51aae8e38921ce5ef08313f8c1/tumblr_inline_p4bqb5vST81r66idw_540.png"/></figure><p>If artists get only likes, they never get any exposure. They find no followers, they make no money, and feel worthless.</p>
<figure class="tmblr-full" data-orig-height="527" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ecd55dd7dfa1212c865512516c0dbe9/tumblr_inline_p4bqb55jYy1r66idw_540.png"><img src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ecd55dd7dfa1212c865512516c0dbe9/tumblr_inline_p4bqbxCPtO1r66idw_540.png" data-orig-height="527" data-orig-width="540" data-orig-src="https://66.media.tumblr.com/3ecd55dd7dfa1212c865512516c0dbe9/tumblr_inline_p4bqb55jYy1r66idw_540.png"/></figure><p>But with reblogs, who knows how far they could reach? New people could see their work and follow them, and maybe one person will spot that commissions post or patreon promo, and maybe offer to help support them. And it didn‚Äôt even cost those followers a penny to reblog the post.</p>
<p>So please, anyone out there. If you enjoy an artist‚Äôs work and can‚Äôt afford to give any monetary support, you can give them something more powerful. A voice.<br/></p>

<p>And authors, too. Please reblog and share author commissions!</p>

<p>To use the first 200 reblogs of this post as an example:¬†</p>

<p>Can I also add!!!!!!</p>
<h2>This doesn‚Äôt work if you repost art. </h2>
<p><i>Especially</i> when you remove the credit, you break the web of connections. Only only only ever repost an artist‚Äôs context if you have ALREADY asked them and they have ALREADY given EXPLICIT permission</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Reblog, don‚Äôt repost.</p>
<p>I don‚Äôt get reposting, reblogging is so much easier? It‚Äôs a button, just right there‚Ä¶. anyways, please boost this and reblog the arts!</p>

<p>Alrite that&rsquo;s my quota of reblogs for this trimester I will now go back to OC <strike>and yes, I realize the irony of me barely ever rebloging anything at all, I will make a reblog tumblr or something if I gain enough traction as an artist for people to care..</strike></p>
