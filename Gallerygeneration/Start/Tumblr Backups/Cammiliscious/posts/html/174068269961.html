<p>AND NOW THAT I GOT YOUR ATTENTION.</p>

<p>I thought it was time I went and said &ldquo;I am alive&rdquo; regarding this. I didn&rsquo;t drop it, there&rsquo;s just life circumstances preventing me from really dedicating to quests so <a href="https://boards.4chan.org/mlp/thread/32294443">Extravaganza</a>, my miniquest, is running at snail&rsquo;s pace.</p>

<p>However if you&rsquo;re impatient, the books acquired at the library of Landly&rsquo;s church of the Rous[<em>sic</em>] <a href="https://legacy.gitbook.com/book/duendeinexistente/cirque/details">are already available</a> , with the changelog detailing what I added. I might also finish a pair of short stories I can&rsquo;t quite decide on about, but that&rsquo;ll happen if it happens.</p>

<p>And with that, thanks for the patience and I have to write Extravaganza now.</p>
