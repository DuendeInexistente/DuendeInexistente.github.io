The desert night was cool, a cold the pony had grown used to on their trek.</i></p><p><i>What was the pony looking for, on the desert? Was it the faraway city, or something in it? A lover, a precious instrument, a home or at least respite? Or was what they sought beyond even regal Canterlot?<br/></i></p><p><i>But there wasn&rsquo;t anybody to talk to, so the pony said nothing, went back to the oars, and the answer remained a mistery for the sands.</i></p><p><i>They kept drifting long after the pony was gone, careless of their ignorance.</i></p></blockquote> </div>
